"Given the provided consolidated groupings of product features, structure the information into a JSON representation. Each main category should serve as the key, and the associated features should be listed in an array as the values. The format should resemble:

```
{
"CategoryName": ["Feature1", "Feature2", ...],
"AnotherCategory": ["FeatureA", "FeatureB", ...],
...
}
```

Using this guideline, please convert the following groupings into the desired JSON format:

(Material: Housing Material, Boiler Material, Drip Tray Material, Grill Material, Carafe Material, ...)
