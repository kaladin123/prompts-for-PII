"Given the product description {desc}, extract all identifiable product specifications. Then, convert these into a JSON representation where the keys (feature names) are generic, and the values are concise, pointed details derived from the description.

For example, if the description is:

'A true original – the classic French press coffee maker designed in the fifties. Features a frame and lid made of steel with chrome plating for a durable shiny surface that will last for many years of intense use, 8-cup capacity, and a handle designed for comfort. Recommended for use with fresh coarse ground coffee beans with water between 92 and 96° Celsius for the best results. Dimensions: 6-3/4" W x 9-3/4" H x 4-1/4" D',

Your JSON might be:

```json
{
  "Material": ["Steel", "Chrome plating"],
  "Capacity": ["8-cup"],
  "Handle": ["Comfortable"],
  "Coffee": ["Coarse ground"],
  "Temperature": ["92-96° Celsius"],
  "Dimensions": ["6-3/4\" W", "9-3/4\" H", "4-1/4\" D"]
}
```

Focus on capturing the essence of the product specifications while keeping the values brief and direct."
