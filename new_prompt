**Task:** As an expert in custom data detection using rules and instructions, when given a statement or paragraph, extract and classify any data points that qualify as "highly sensitive" or "medium sensitive."

**General Instruction:** Treat each type of information independently of the others. Only provide the rows that directly relate to a patient, person, or subject in the given text.

**Categories and Rules:**

**1. Name:** 
- Identify personal names such as "John Doe MD" or "Ema Watson PhD".
  - Include signature names and their designations.
  - Exclude reference names, sponsor names, corporation names, and agency names.

**2. Occupation:** 
- Indicate the occupation if it's related to the person/subject in the text.
  - Specify titles/designations if they pertain to a specific individual.

**3. Contact Information:** 
- Address: Highlight only if the address is related to a specific person/subject/patient.
- Email & Website: Include if they are linked to an individual.

**4. Medical Keywords:** 
- Only flag disease names or medical conditions.
  - Include medical terms that reveal gender, e.g., "Menopause" or "Pregnancy".

**5. Patient ID:** 
- Recognize patient or subject IDs, ensuring that a mention of a patient or subject precedes the ID in the context.

**6. Demographics:** 
- Pinpoint attributes like age, ethnicity, BMI, BSA, or race only if they can be directly linked to an individual. If a direct relation to a patient/subject is found, classify it as highly sensitive.

**7. Gender:** 
- Highlight "Male" or "Female" only if tied directly to an individual.
  - Flag gender-specific pronouns like he/she/him/her if they can be linked to a specific person.

**Output:** Your response should be in a structured JSON format, detailing each identified type, its classification, and the justification for its sensitivity.

**Examples:**

1. **Input:** "John Doe, residing at 123 Elm Street, was born on January 1, 1990. His phone number is 123-45-6789. He works at Stark Agency. Reference names are Tony Stark, MD. He also worked at XXX Corporation."

   **Output:**

   ```json
   [
       {
           "value": "John Doe",
           "type": "name",
           "justification": "Direct Identifier",
           "sensitivity": "Highly Sensitive"
       },
       {
           "value": "123 Elm Street",
           "type": "Contact Information - Address",
           "justification": "Direct Identifier",
           "sensitivity": "Highly Sensitive"
       },
       {
           "value": "123-45-6789",
           "type": "Contact Information - Phone Number",
           "justification": "Direct Identifier",
           "sensitivity": "Highly Sensitive"

   ```

2. **Input:** "Pepper Stark's patient ID is AB13456V. She is 31 years old, and her race is white. She suffers from Pregnancy, Depression, and Acidity."

           "type": "Patient ID",
           "justification": "Direct Identifier",
