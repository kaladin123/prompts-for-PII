Understood. I'll further refine the prompt to ensure that the categorization of features is not based on the product names. Here's the revised prompt:

---

**Prompt**:

Given the list of product features below, categorize the features into logical categories based on their functionalities, irrespective of specific product names. Ensure the categories are clear, concise, and functionally relevant. The features within each category should be closely related. Provide the output in a dictionary format where the key represents the category name and the value is a list of features under that category.

**Product Features**:
- [List of Features]

**Example Output**:

```python
categories = {
    "Category Name 1": ["Feature 1", "Feature 2", ...],
    "Category Name 2": ["Feature A", "Feature B", ...],
    ...
}
```

Replace "[List of Features]" with the appropriate feature names for which you need categorization, and the model should provide a categorization in the format indicated by the example output.
