Given a list of features extracted from product descriptions, please group these features based on their functionality. Organize the features into categories that best describe their primary use or characteristic. 

For example:

Input:

```
features = ["Face ID", "OLED Display", "Waterproof", "Quick Charge"]
```

Output:

```
{{
    "Display Technologies": ["OLED Display"],
    "Unlocking Mechanisms": ["Face ID"],
    "Water Resistance": ["Waterproof"],
    "Charging Technologies": ["Quick Charge"]
}}
```

Now, using the above guidance, please categorize the following features:

```
feature_names = {feature_names}
```
